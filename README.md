# 📊 Football Data Visualization Using Python: A Step-by-Step Journey 

## ⚽ Season 2021 - English Premier League

This project analyzes Premier League team statistics using various data visualization techniques to extract insights. Below is the step-by-step breakdown:

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Initial Analysis - Goals by Teams
We started with a **bar chart** to compare team goals.
- ✅ Highlighted **top-scoring** and **lowest-scoring** teams.

## 🔹 Step 2: Most Aggressive Teams
We used a **bar chart** to compare team **red and yellow cards**.
- ✅ Identified the most aggressive teams and their roughness of play.

## 🔹 Step 3: Most Shooting Teams
Another **bar chart** was used to highlight:
- ✅ Top-shooting teams.
- ✅ Lowest-shooting teams.

## 🔹 Step 4: Possession % vs Team Rating
Analyzed possession percentage against team ratings:
- ✅ Some teams dominate possession but have an average rating (**Arsenal**).
- ✅ Some teams have lower possession but play more direct (**West Ham**).
- ✅ This highlights different **play styles** in the league.

## 🔹 Step 5: Shot Accuracy - Goals per Shot Attempted
Visualized goal conversion efficiency:
- ✅ **Calculated** goals per shot attempted for each team.
- ✅ Used a **scatter plot** and **line plot** to show conversion efficiency.
- ✅ Highlighted teams with high conversion rates.

## 🔹 Step 6: Radar Chart for Top 5 Teams Performance Comparison
To analyze team strengths across multiple metrics, we implemented a **radar chart**:
- ✅ Plotted multiple attributes (**goals, possession, shots, etc.**).
- ✅ **Aston Villa** relies on high balls.
- ✅ **Manchester City** dominates possession and passing.
- ✅ **Liverpool** attempts the most shots.
